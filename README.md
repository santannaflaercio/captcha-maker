This repository contains a simple CAPTCHA creator project. The project generates a random CAPTCHA image with 6
characters, including letters and numbers.

The project explore the use of the `captcha` library in Python to generate CAPTCHA images. The `captcha` library is a
simple CAPTCHA image generator. It allows you to create your own CAPTCHA images, and verify that the user's input
matches the generated image.

## What is a CAPTCHA?

CAPTCHA stands for "Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart". It is a type of
challenge and response test used in computing to determine whether or not the user is human. CAPTCHAs are used to
prevent bots from automatically submitting forms and accessing websites.

## How to Run

For additional customization options, you may modify the variable values within the `generator.py` file to suit your
preferences.

```python
number_of_captchas = 10  # Number of captcha images to be generated
number_of_characters = 6  # Number of characters in the captcha
```

## Expected Output

The following images are examples of CAPTCHAs generated by the project:

### Example 1

![Captcha Sample 00](data/samples/captcha_sample00.png)

### Example 2

![Captcha Sample 01](data/samples/captcha_sample01.png)

### Example 3
